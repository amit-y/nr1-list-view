# List View has moved to [Labs Widget Pack](https://github.com/newrelic/nr-labs-widget-pack)

❗ This repo is no longer actively maintained. 

# List View

List View is a [custom visualization](https://developer.newrelic.com/explore-docs/custom-viz/) that displays NRQL-queried data in a list. It accepts a NRQL query and a [template](./template.md) for how the data should be displayed, and turns this into a list.

## Features

- Coerce values to number, date and boolean types
- Format numbers and dates
- Convert between digital size types (bytes, kilobytes, ...)
- Search bar to quickly find matching text within the list

Read the [Template String documentation](./template.md) for details.

## Getting started

1. Ensure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed. If you're unsure whether you have one or both of them installed, run the following command. (If you have them installed these commands will return a version number, if not, the commands won't be recognized.)

   ```bash
   git --version
   npm -v
   ```

2. Install the [New Relic One CLI](https://one.newrelic.com/developer-center) by going to [this link](https://one.newrelic.com/developer-center) and following the instructions (5 minutes or less) to install and set up your New Relic development environment.

3. Run the following command to clone this repository and run the code locally against your New Relic data:

   ```bash
   nr1 nerdpack:clone -r https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nr1-list-view.git
   cd nr1-list-view
   nr1 nerdpack:serve --mode=prod
   ```

Visit [https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local](https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local), navigate to the Nerdpack, and :sparkles:

## Deploying this Nerdpack

# To see a list of APIkeys / profiles available in your development environment:
# nr1 profiles:list

nr1 nerdpack:publish [--profile=your_profile_name]
nr1 nerdpack:deploy [-c [DEV|BETA|STABLE]] [--profile=your_profile_name]
